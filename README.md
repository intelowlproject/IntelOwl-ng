Official web client for [Intel Owl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/intelowl), a scalable API which gathers
threat intelligence data about a particular file or observable (ip, domain, url,
hash) by querying many different analyzers and services that are externally or
internally available.

Built with [Angular 9](https://github.com/angular/angular) on top of [ngx-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin). 

#### Demo

[Live Demo](https://intelowlclient.firebaseapp.com/)

> The demo does not yet contain many new features.

## Features

- A dashboard to display different visualizations of Job data, with the following features: 
    - Tabular view of all jobs which can be filtered, sorted or searched through. 
    - Pie charts for visualizing job data on the basis of `status`, `observable_classification`, `file_mimetype` and `is_sample`. 
    - Clicking on any slice on the Pie Chart will filter the jobs list based on the selected classification. 
    - “Save as PNG” feature for the graphs. 
- Job result can be viewed as a nested list or prettified JSON. 
- [`analyzer_config.json`](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/configuration/analyzer_config.json) 
from IntelOwl in a tabular view which can be filtered, sorted or searched through. Along with this, there's also a dendogram tree view. 
- Requesting new analysis/scans with simple-to-use forms. They take care of warnings for you and 
also lets you specify tags to group different analysis' together.

## Docker

IntelOwl-ng's Docker image on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/intelowlproject/intelowl_ng) is a data-only image. In other terms, it's a scratch image that contains only the final production build artifacts and cannot be started as a container. This makes the image super light-weight i.e. ~10 mb uncompressed and we can use Docker's multi-stage builds to inject these build artifacts into another base container such as `nginx`. Official [example](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/develop/Dockerfile_nginx) from Intel Owl repository.

> You should never need to build/start this docker image yourself, you should always use the docker-compose files from main IntelOwl repository.

## Installation

For a development server, we make use of proxy configuration given in [proxy.config.json](proxy.conf.json) to make calls to the backend server.
Therefore, this application requires Intel Owl running on `http://localhost:80` (by default). If you wish to change this URL, you can do so by changing
the `target` parameter in [proxy.config.json](proxy.conf.json).
